0) If you want, make a new folder somewhere in your file structure where you can put your source code

1) Click the green button labelled 'Code' (by 'Go to file')
A window will pop up with 'Clone' and 'HTTPS' - ignore those and click 'Download ZIP' at the bottom

2) The source code has been downloaded as auto-ct-main.zip
Go to your Downloads folder though File Explorer (Windows) or Files (Linux) or Finder (MacOS).
On windows:
	Right-click the auto-ct-main.zip folder and then click 'Extract All'
	Select a destination to extract to*
On Linux:
	Right-click the auto-ct-main.zip folder and then click 'Open with Archive Manager'
	In the box labelled 'Location' put the location where you want to store the files*
On Mac:
	Double click the auto-ct-main.zip folder
	There will now be an unzipped folder with the same name in your Downloads directory
	Move that folder to a location*

*you can put the source files wherever you want, I recommend a 'workout' folder in Home or if you have a 'random_crap' folder you can put it there, or you can leave these in Downloads, whatever

Download of source is complete!

3) Now open your terminal (don't be intimidated lol) and navigate to the location where you saved your folder. You can do this with cd: 'cd' once to go to your home directory and then ls to see all your folders and then 'cd [foldername]' and then 'ls' again and then if necessary 'cd [foldername]' again until you are in the folder that contains the files you recently extracted). If you know the absolute path from Home, you can just type 'cd ~/[absolute_path]/[another_folder]/auto-ct-main'

4) Once you are in the folder containing the files 'workout.py' and 'setup.py', type 'python3 setup.py', but first make sure you have python3 and pip3 installed
You can check this by typing 
python3 --version (output should be similar to 'Python 3.8.5')
pip3 --version (output should be similar to 'pip 20.0.2 from /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pip (python 3.8)')

Great, you have completed setting up this program! Refer back to the readme.md page for more information on how to use this :)
