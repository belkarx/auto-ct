Chrome:
1) Check your Chrome version through [3 dots in corner] -> Help -> About Google Chrome
A page should come up with this information (The version number may be different but it will be in that format):
	Version 88.0.4324.150 (Official Build) (64-bit)

2) Go to https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
	At the very top, there will be a list titled 'Current releases'
	Underneath you will see a few lines following this format:
		If you are using Chrome version X, please download ChromeDriver XX.X.XXX.XX

	From the information you gathered in Step 1, click the link with the version that corresponds
	For example, I have Chrome version 88.0.4324.150 so I would click the hyperlink 'ChromeDriver 88.0.4324.96' on the line 'If you are using Chrome version 88, please download ChromeDriver 88.0.4324.96'
	If you are for some reason using an older version of Chrome that isn't in 'Current releases', scroll down until you find a hyperlink that says 'ChromeDriver [Your Version Number]' (for example, ChromeDriver 85.0.4183.87)

3) When you click the link corresponding to your browser version, a page will come up:

4) Click the link that corresponds with your operating system:
	if you are running windows, click chromedriver_win32.zip (if for some reason there's only win32 and not win64, apparently that's not a mistake but win32 works on both 32 and 64 bit operating systems lol)
	if you have a regular mac, click chromedriver_mac64.zip
	if you have a mac m1 (the newest architecture), click chromedriver_mac64_m1.zip	
	if you are running linux, click chromedriver_linux64.zip
 
5) When you click the *.zip file, a compressed (zipped) file with the same name as the link you clicked will be downloaded to your computer, likely in your Downloads folder

[if you know what you are doing, you can check the checksum here before unzipping)

6) Go to your Downloads folder though File Explorer (Windows) or Files (Linux) or Finder(MacOS).
On windows:
	Right-click the .zip folder and then click 'Extract All'
	Select a destination to extract to that is on your PATH (C:/Windows is recommended)
On Linux:
	Right-click the .zip folder and then click 'Open with Archive Manager'
	In the box labelled 'Location' put a location that is on your PATH (I recommend /usr/bin)
On Mac:
	Double click the folder
	There will now be an unzipped folder with the same name in your Downloads directory
	Move that folder to a location on your PATH (I recommend /usr/bin)

(or you can move it wherever (make a folder names .selenium in home or something and then put that location on your PATH)

You have now installed Chrome's webdriver and can use web automation. Congratulations!
