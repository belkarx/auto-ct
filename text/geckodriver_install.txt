Firefox:
1) Go to https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases
	If you scroll down to the bottom of the page, you will see a list titled 'Assets' that resembles this:
	Assets (9)
		geckodriver-v0.29.0-linux32.tar.gz		2.71 MB
		geckodriver-v0.29.0-linux32.tar.gz.asc	833 Bytes
		geckodriver-v0.29.0-linux64.tar.gz		2.53 MB
		geckodriver-v0.29.0-linux64.tar.gz.asc	833 Bytes
		geckodriver-v0.29.0-macos.tar.gz		1.79 MB
		geckodriver-v0.29.0-win32.zip			1.37 MB
		geckodriver-v0.29.0-win64.zip			1.44 MB
		Source code (zip)
		Source code (tar.gz)
		
You may notice that there are a few different compression types, you can choose whichever but it's simplest to just choose the one ending in .tar.gz or .zip

Click a link ending in 32 if you are running a 32-bit system (which is rather unlikely but if you want to make sure, check your Firefox version through [3 horizontal lines in corner] -> Help -> About Firefox and a page should come up with something similar to this information -> '71.0 (64-bit), Mozilla for Ubuntu')

3) Assuming you are running 64-bit architecture, click the link that corresponds with your operating system:
	if you are running windows, click geckodriver-v[some_version]-win64.zip
	if you are running MacOS, click geckodriver-v[some_version]-macos.tar.gz
	if you have a Mac M1, Firefox unfortunately doesn't support that architecture yet. Maybe try Chrome instead?	
	if you are running Linux, click geckodriver-v[some version]-linux64.tar.gz

For example, I am running 64-bit Linux so I would choose geckodriver-v[some version]-linux64.tar.gz
 
5) When you click the compressed (.zip or .tar.gz) file, a file with the same name as the link you clicked will be downloaded to your computer, likely in your Downloads folder

6) Go to your Downloads folder though File Explorer (Windows) or Files (Linux) or Finder(MacOS).
On windows:
	Right-click the .zip folder and then click 'Extract All'
	Select a destination to extract to that is on your PATH (C:/Windows is recommended)
On Linux:
	Right-click the .zip folder and then click 'Open with Archive Manager'
	In the box labelled 'Location' put a location that is on your PATH (I recommend /usr/bin)
On Mac:
	Double click the folder
	There will now be an unzipped folder with the same name in your Downloads directory
	Move that folder to a location on your PATH (I recommend /usr/bin)

(or you can move it wherever (make a folder names .selenium in home or something and then put that location on your PATH)

You have now installed Firefox's webdriver and can use web automation. Congratulations!
